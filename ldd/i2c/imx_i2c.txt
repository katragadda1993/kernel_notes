I2C is a two-wire, bidirectional serial bus that provides a simple, efficient method of data
exchange, minimizing the interconnection between devices. This bus is suitable for
applications requiring occasional communications over a short distance between many
devices


The I2C interface operates up to 400 kbps, but the speed is dependent on the I2C bus
loading and timing characteristics. For pin requirement details, refer to Philips I2C Bus
Specification, Version 2.1. The I2C system is a true multiple-master bus including
arbitration and collision detection that prevents data corruption if multiple devices
attempt to control the bus simultaneously. This feature supports complex applications
with multiprocessor control and can be used for rapid testing and alignment of end
products through external connections to an assembly-line computer. The figure below
shows the block diagram of I2C
